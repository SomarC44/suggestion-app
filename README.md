A small summary of how the app works:

This is a suggestion app I created, allowing content creators to connect with their followers/subscribers and listen to their content suggestions. 
The app in its current layout is geared toward a content creator teaching their subscribers how to code!
When navigating the main page, users can scroll through and upvote currently approved suggestions. Each suggestion element will show the suggestion title, 
its category, the number of upvotes it has (if any), and the current status of the suggestion (if any).
Users can create suggestions and upvote other users' suggestions as well. Each suggestion will be created 
with zero upvotes, and users can't upvote their own suggestions. 
clicking on a suggestion will take you to the suggestion's details page, where you can see the suggestion's 
description, its author, the date it was created, how many upvotes it has, and it's current status (if it has one). 
You can also upvote the suggestion from its details page.
Users can search for specific topics using the search bar, and also sort the suggestions by new or popular, as well as by category and/or status.
Each user also has a profile page, where it will show their pending, approved, and rejected suggestions. Users can also edit their profile and 
change their first name, last name, and display name. 

When using an account that has been given admin privileges, adding additional functionality.
When a suggestion is created, it will go to the admin approval page. A user with admin privileges can access this page by using the admin button 
on the top right. Admins can approve/reject suggestions, as well as edit their title and description to fix any typos.
After a suggestion is approved by an admin, it will be added to the main page of the app, without a status. 
Admins can click on a suggestion to go to its details page and add a status, or change its status from one to another. 
Admins can also archive a suggestion when it is very old and has no engagement. 

Feel free to click through the app and test out its functionality!
